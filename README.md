## Tools used

<li> Unity </li>
<li> C# </li>
</ul>


## Info
<h4> Word: Resistance </h4>
<p> Based on my reading, what I got from it is how black people are constantly struggling with there Identity being taken away 
from them, such as their clothing style, dance, songs and etc. The goal of the game is to take your identity into the safe space but 
as you walk through your journey you are going to encounter the enemies that are going to try to take leach on to you and 
deal damage to your identity. So your goal is to avoid as many of them so you donâ€™t deal damage and make it to your safe space.</p> 

## Improvements
<p>This is my first time exploring with unity and C# so there are some fuantionally that still need improvment, such as being 
able to drop your identy anywhere and showing your life bar when you get attack by the enemy</p>
